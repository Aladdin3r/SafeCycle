         correctAnswer: "at a crosswalk",
         lesson: "When crossing the street, it's essential to use designated crosswalks whenever possible.

        type: "radio",
        choices: ["push the button and wait for the “walk” signal", 
                    "push the button and cross the street right away",

         correctAnswer: "push the button and wait for the “walk” signal",
         lesson: "When encountering an intersection with a 'push button for walk' signal, it's important to follow pedestrian crossing signals to ensure safety. Pushing the button activates the pedestrian signal, indicating to drivers that pedestrians are waiting to cross. Wait for the 'walk' signal before crossing the street, as crossing against the signal may lead to accidents. Always obey traffic signals and signs to prevent accidents and ensure pedestrian safety."

        qText: "When walking on a road with no sidewalk, you should _",
        type: "radio",
        choices: ["walk on the left side of the road facing traffic", 
                  "walk on the right side of the road with traffic", 
                  "walk in the middle of the road", 
                  "walk on the right side of the road facing traffic"],
         correctAnswer: "walk on the right side of the road facing traffic",
         lesson: "When walking on a road without a sidewalk, it's crucial to prioritize safety and visibility. Pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic to see and be seen by vehicles. Walking against traffic allows pedestrians to react to approaching vehicles and increases their visibility to drivers. This practice reduces the risk of accidents and ensures that both pedestrians and drivers can navigate safely on roads without sidewalks.",
